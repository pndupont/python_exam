For a red belt:
    Login and Registration with validations
        Validation errors should appear on the page
        Logout feature
    Dashboard
        "Remove" link appears if the logged user is the one who created the job
        "Remove" link removes the job from the database
        "Edit" link appears if the logged user is the one who created the job
        "Edit" link routes to the edit page
        Dashboard should say "Hello {{user}}"
        "View" link routes to the individual job page
    View a job
        View page includes all details about the job
    Add a job
        Validation for empty input fields
        Title must be greater than three characters long
        Description must be greater than three characters long
        Location must be greater than three characters long
    Edit a job
        Same validations as when creating a job
    HTML and CSS reflect the wireframe to at least 75% accuracy


For a black belt:
You must be able to deploy your work to Amazon EC2 and provide the IP address or subdomain/domain name to where your work has been deployed
     Please note that Heroku deployment is not honored
"Add" link must add the job to the My Jobs list that is unique to the user, "Give up" removes the job from the user's job list and back onto the table of all jobs
When a user adds a job to their own list, it must also be removed from the jobs table
"Add To My Jobs" and "Give up" links on the individual job page must do the same as the links on the dashboard
Edit page input fields must be pre-populated with current data from the database
Done link on the user's My Jobs list deletes the job from the database
Each job must belong to at least one category
Also:
Create a short video walking through the features of your app. Show your validations working. There is no need to speak or show your code.
Remove your github repo after deploying.
If you are using Flask, include a file with the SQL script to create your database (this can be copied when you forward engineer your ERD)
The wireframe is available for download here.
Donâ€™t worry about:
What the prompts are asking for. Just ask if you are unsure about what the goals are!
